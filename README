fIRST YOU NEED TO DOWNLOAD THE FILES FROM THE GITHUB :
https://github.com/Yatodak/DevOpsCTF


FOR GUACAMOLE SERVER :

GUACD NEED TO BE PLACED IN /usr/local/sbin
DO NOT RENAME THE FILE


SERVICE FILE LOCATED IN guacd_service NEED TO BE PLACED AT /etc/init.d/
DO NOT RENAME THE FILE


FOR GUACAMOLE GUI :

FIRST SET THE UMASK :
# umask 022

YOU NEED TO CREATE A USER CALLED TOMCAT :
# sudo useradd -r -s /usr/sbin/nologin tomcat

MOVE THE TOMCAT FOLDER TO /opt

ADD A LOG FOLDER FOR TOMCAT :
# sudo mkdir /var/log/tomcat
# sudo chown tomcat:adm /var/log/tomcat
# sudo chmod 750 /var/log/tomcat
# sudo chmod g+s /var/log/tomcat


REPLACE THE CATALINE LOGS FOLDER WITH THE NEW LOGS FOLDER :
# cd /opt/tomcat
# sudo rm -rf logs
# sudo ln -s /var/log/tomcat /opt/tomcat/logs

NOW CONFIGURE FILE PERMISSIONS :
# sudo chown -R root:tomcat /opt/tomcat
# sudo chmod g+r /opt/tomcat/conf/*
# sudo chmod g+w /opt/tomcat/temp /opt/tomcat/work

NOW VERIFY THAT TOMCAT ONLY AS WRITE ACCESS TO TEMP, WORK AND LOGS AND REMOVE ALL OTHER USER PERMISSIONS TO TOMCAT FOLDER :
# sudo chmod -R o-rwx /opt/tomcat/


ADD THE tomcat.service FILE IN /etc/systemd/system/

TO RUN, TOMCAT NEED THE JAVA_HOME VARIABLE POINTING TO THE RIGHT JDK FOLDER
BY DEFAULT THE FOLDER IS SET IN THE SERVICE FILE AT /usr/lib/jvm/java-19-openjdk-amd64
IF YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT FOLDER, YOU NEED TO MODIFY THE ENVIRONEMENT VARIABLE IN THE tomcat.service FILE
